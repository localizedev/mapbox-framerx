# FramerX - Mapbox Component

## Feature Overview
This project is a work in progress.
The goal of the project is to build a powerful Mapbox prototyping tool in FramerX, allowing us to link between different map states and page element states.
In the Demo, we used this tool to link cards to a specific map state of the layers’ visibility and camera position.

**Unchecked items are not on the project yet, but planned for release and should show up in the future.**
### Camera initial set up (in “Map Component”)
[x] Latitude/longitude 
[x] Zoom level
[x] Pitch
[x] Bearing
### Camera state set up (per-card)
[x] Latitude/longitude 
[x] Zoom level
[x] Pitch
[x] Bearing
[ ] Zoom to feature/layer
### Visibility
[x] Hide layers: inherit setting from the map
[x] Show layers: override
### Data source manipulation
[ ] Override layer info: Target layer and add a custom source file override (url/GeoJSON)
[ ] Filter by layer type 
### Parametric design
[ ] Dynamic styling: conditional styling based on dataset values.

Much of the initial development of this component has taken place in the [“Design Tools Hackathon 2018”](https://www.designtoolstlv.com/), hosted in Tel-Aviv.
This component is in active development.
Further documentation will be added as we go.
